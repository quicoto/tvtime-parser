# TV Time parser

Generate an HTML output of your tv shows.

## Instructions

1. Copy and paste your profile into `input.txt`

2. Chose your next step: Github Actions or in your own terminal.

### Terminal

If using the terminal, you can do:

```node process.js > output.html```

### Github Actions

With the repo's Github Action workflow on each push of the master branch we'll create an artifact attached to the build. So you can download the HTML file.
